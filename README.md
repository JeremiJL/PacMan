# Pac-Man based desktop game developed in Java, Swing.

### Application Description :

Game challenges player to collect coins while evading 'ghosts' equipped with graph traversal algorithms that track their movements. 
To add an extra excitement to gameplay experience, my Pac-Man implementation comes with periodically generated power ups as well as transformations of labyrinth after each level.

### Note : 

The project was developed during my early stages of learning Java, which resulted in several solutions that may appear outdated 
or implemented using poor programming practices.

A ground-level rebuild of the application is necessary for potential further development.
